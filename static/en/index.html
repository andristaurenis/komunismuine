				<h2>What are you talking about? Is there communism in Lithuania?</h2>
				<p>This specter is everywhere. Regardless of the many human rights violation scandals very few governments have taken a firm stance against this. We can see how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has extended its tenticles to international organizations, governments, educational establishments, companies and even idividuals. As it thightens its grip on the world we can look inside China to understand how bad it can get. Like in an Orwellian state each individual can feel its grip, there is no privacy and no freedom of thought not to mention freedom of speech, association, belief and there is no justice.</p>
				<p>Our inability to stand up against the most horrifying crimes against humanity is an indicator that we are under its dominion already. Most have not tried to stand up to CCP. Those who do have felt the resistance of the specter even outside China. This is a question of individual freedom, national sovereignity and more, because it is no secret that the CCP is ambitious to rule over the world.</p>

				<h2>How much of this can be seen in Lithuania?</h2>

                In Lithuania there is the Chinese embassy and the Confucius Institute and the various businesses with close ties to China, but their magnitude of influence is hard to estimate. However there is an indirect measurement of CCP influence - number of virus patients. While CCP virus patient amounts in Lithuania do not seem tragic the reader should remember two things. 1) Even a single CCP agent in Lithuania is one agent too much. 2) Viruses are very contagious - once the critical mass is reached the outbreak will not be containable.</p>

                        CCP has been the ruling party in China for 70 years. During its rule it has systematically destroyed traditional culture and values, undermined moral values, plunged society into poverty, killed millions and esablished atheism. Any religion in China must worship communism first and God second. Churches and temples exist for making money and showing to foreigners while the uncensored version of the Bible is considered „evil cult material”. Falun Gong practicioners, Uyghurs, Tibetians and house church christians.
                        Good. systematic destruction of traditional values (ban on bible); Mao personality cult (simmilarity to Nero); persecution(practicioners suffering not less than Jesus)

                        Having close ties to China in this age has serious national security and wellbeing implications.
                        Last year the Independent Tribunal into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience in China concluded that the alligations are true and declared in its conclusions that China is a criminal state.
                        To illustrate the severity of the issue consider this - Lithuania could be doing business with the Russian mafia and welcome their leaders as guests of honor in our country and have them meet the president and shake hands. That would probably be more profitable and less harmful to the Lithuanian nation, its identity and image.
                        Many countries during CCP virus crisis have found themselves being at mercy of Beijing. Those heavily reliying on China for medical supplies now get to suffer from CCPs realpolitik practices - hoarding of critical medical supplies, exporting malfunctioning supplies. It uses the pandemic as political leverage to further its political goals. It has threathened to sink USA „into the mighty sea of coronavirus.”
                        </p><p>
                        From the pandemic we see that the very existence of CCP is a global threath. Not only it tried to cover up the initial outbreak that allowed the virus to spread globally, but it also refuses to provide intelligence to combat the virus more effectively and develop a vaccine.
                        Even now CCP continues to sprad lies underreporting numbers and trying to pin the outbreak on other countries. Their propoganda departament even wrote a book to praise itself for its handling of the epidemic and it has been translated in many languages.
                        For outsiders it is hard to immagine how mislead people in China are - many truly believe that this virus originated in USA and many believe that in China there are no new virus cases and believe the numbers reported by CCP.
                        </p><p>
                        For the sake of all humanity the CCP should be disintegrated as soon as possible.

                <h2>Petition text</h2>
                <p>Peticija Lietuvos Respublikos Seimo pirmininkui, Lietuvos Respublikos ministrui pirmininkui - su raginimu imtis veiksmų, kad būtų nedelsiant nutrauktas masinis organų grobimas ir praktikuojančių Falun Gong (Falun Dafa) bei kitų sąžinės kalinių Kinijoje persekiojimas.</p>
                <p>Mes, Lietuvos Respublikos piliečiai, raginame jus priimti tvirtas nuostatas prieš Kinijos komunistų partijos nuo 1999 m. liepos 20 d. vykdomas praktikuojančių Falun Gong represijas, įskaitant neteisėtą kalinimą kalėjimuose, smegenų plovimo contruose, kankinimus bei masines žudynes dėl organų transplantacijos.</p>
                <p>Mes, žemiau pasirašiusieji, esame šokiruoti pateiktais šių veiksmų įrodymais. Manome, kad žudymas dėl organų yra nusikaltimas žmonijai ir blogio pasireiškimas jo kraštutine forma. Mūsų moraline pareiga yra pasiekti, kad Lietuvos Seimas tarpvalstybine rezoliucija pasmerktų tuos žiaurumus. Esame įsitikinė, kad tai užkirs kelią Kinijai taikyti tokius pat nusikalstamus metodus uigūrų, tibetiečių ir krikščionių atžvilgiu. Taigi mes reikalaujame iš Lietuvos valdžios institucijų:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Pareikalauti, kad Kinija nedelsiant nutrauktų areštuotų praktikuojančių Falun Gang organų grobimą.</li>
                    <li>Pradėti tolesnį tyrima, kurio dėka galima bus patraukti baudžiamojon atsakomybėn kaltininkus, susijusius su Kinija dėl šio nusikaltimo žmonijai.</li>
                    <li>Pareikalauti, kat Kinijos vyriausybė nedelsiant nutrauktų bet kokius praktikuojančių Falun Gang persekiojimus, taip pat jų organų grobimą, kas yra nusikaltimas žmonijai.</li>
                    <li>Įgyvendinti 2013 m. gruodžio 12 d. Europos Parlamento rezoliuciją dėl galimybės gauti organus iš Kinijos panaikinimo.</li>
                </ol>
