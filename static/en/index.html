				<h2>Communism is a specter</h2>
				<p>Regardless of the many human rights violation scandals in China very few governments have taken a firm stance against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It was convenient (for economic reasons) to continue believing its promises to improve the human rights situation and look the other way while in reality for serveral decades human rights violations have only gotten worse.
                </p><p>
                We can see how the CCP has extended its tenticles

				<h2>Amount of CCP influence in Lithuania</h2>
				<p>
                In Lithuania there is the Chinese embassy and the Confucius Institute and the various businesses with close ties to China, but their magnitude of influence is hard to estimate. However there is an indirect measurement of CCP influence - number of Wuhan virus patients.
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/3/21/183720.html">We can see</a>
                that countries with close ties to CCP have been hit the hardest, while those that distance themselves are overcoming the crisis with ease.
                Many countries during the crisis have found themselves being at 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/4/2/183874.html">mercy of Beijing</a>.
                Those heavily reliying on China for medical supplies now get to suffer from CCP 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/5/3/184306.html">hoarding</a>

                to downplay the severity of the virus - an act that only further illustrates to what extent it infiltrates international bodies.
                </p><p>
                Because of the 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/5/19/185087.html">dispicable handling</a>.
                of COVID-19 many 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/03/24/the-campaign-to-call-the-coronavirus-the-ccp-virus/">refer to it</a>
                as the CCP virus. And for good reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    When there were first reports on the existence of a new coronavirus, doctors who discovered it were prohibited by the CCP to spread information about it. After seeing that CCP is not taking any action they did so anyway through social media. As a result they were arrested for „spreading rumors”.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Continiously and knowingly 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/4/20/184118.html">underreporting</a>
                    infection cases as well as suppressing attempts to gather real data. The estimated actual amounts are 10 times larger than those reported.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Using the virus to further its political goals. Most notable examples are threathening to sink USA „into the mighty sea of coronavirus” and publishing a 
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/3/5/183520.html">book</a>
                    to praise itself for its handling of the epidemic and portraying itself as a hero. This book has even been translated in several languages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Trying to blame other countries for the outbreak, for example Italy, Japan and USA.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                From the pandemic we see that the very existence of CCP is a global threath. Not only it tried to cover up the initial outbreak that allowed the virus to spread globally, but it also 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/4/27/184217.html">refuses</a>
                to provide intelligence to combat the virus more effectively and develop a vaccine.
                Even now CCP continues to sprad lies underreporting numbers and trying to pin the outbreak on other countries through rumors an conspiracy theories.
                For outsiders it is hard to immagine
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2010/9/14/119991.html">how mislead</a>
                people in China are - many truly believe that this virus originated in USA and many believe that in China there are no new virus cases and believe the numbers reported by CCP.

                </p><p>
                Realpolitik practices with complete disregard to human life, dignity, morals and culture are nothing new for the CCP.
                Last year the Independent Tribunal into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience in China concluded that the alligations are true and declared in its conclusions that China is a criminal state.
                To illustrate the severity of the issue consider this - Lithuania could be doing business with the Russian mafia and welcome their leaders as guests of honor in our country and have them meet the president and shake hands. That would probably be less harmful to the Lithuanian nation, its identity and image.
                </p><p>
                Having any ties to China in this age has serious national security and wellbeing implications.
                While the amount of virus patients in Lithuania do not seem tragic the reader should remember two things. 1) Even a single virus patient in Lithuania is one patient too much. 2) Viruses are very contagious - once the critical mass is reached the outbreak will not be containable. (This paragraph was a metaphor - CCP is the virus)</p>

				<h2>CCP's collapse is heaven's mandate</h2>
                 <p>
                CCP has been the ruling party in China for 70 years. During its rule it has systematically destroyed traditional culture and values, undermined moral values, plunged society into poverty, killed millions and esablished atheism. Any religion in China must 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-25/crosses-burned-in-china-religion-crackdown/10301956">worship communism first</a>
                and God second.
                Churches and temples exist for making money and showing to foreigners while the uncensored version of the Bible is considered „evil cult material”. Falun Gong practicioners, Uyghurs, Tibetians and house church christians are all being persecuted for their beliefs.
                </p><p>
                This is not much different from what happened in the Roman Empire. The emperor would expect to be worshiped as God. Christians at the time would refuse to do that so they would be persecuted and the persecution lasted for 300 years. Moreover those following Christ were slandered and accused of crimes they did not commit. During this time terrible plagues broke out.
                </p><p>
                In China during the Cultural Revolution in 1969 Mao was also worshiped like a God. His little red book would be studied as a sacred text. Many cultural treasures would be destroyed and traditional religion persecuted. Atheism was established, but it would be more accurate to call it worship of Maoism. While Mao is dead his personality cult lives on. Children are indoctrinated with political theory from early childhood.
                </p><p>
                In 1993 Master Li Hongzhi made public the practice of Falun Gong. It is a spiritual practice based on the principle „Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance” and encourages returning to traditional values. Because of the many health benifits in a very short time it became very popular. In 1999 there were more people practicing than communist party members. Even high standing government officials were practicing it.
                </p><p>
                Even though Falun Gong teaches not to get involved in politics and positions itself as non religious. Undercover investigations carried out by CCP also showed that this group has no secret agenda and brings much good and no harm.
                </p><p>
                Out of jealosy and paranoia the former communist party leader Jiang Zemin unilaterally decided to destroy the practice and hoped to achieve his goal in a few months. For this an extrajudicial organization was created in June 10th 1999 and named after the date of its creation - the „610 Office”. Because Jiang did not even trust the members of the politburo - who did not support his decision - the 610 Office had more authority than the Supreme court or any other govermental institution.
                </p><p>
                For over 20 years the most violent persecution in history has been taking place. Employing the 70 years of experience in creating social discord and all latest technological advancments the CCP has spared no effort or expenses to destroy a group of meditating pacifists. Some horrifying and unnerving items are excluded -

                    <u>click to see full list.</u>
                </a>).
                Torture methods include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <div id="sensitive" style="display:none">
                    <li>Internal organ harvesting with the victim being conscious and breathing (he dies).</li>
                    <li>Injecting nerve-damaging drugs.</li>
                    <li>Forced late term abortion (up to the 9th month).</li>
                    <li>Electric baton shocking to the face and genital area.</li>
                    </div>
                    <li>Shocking with electric batons.</li>
                    <li>Beating until loss of consciousness.</li>
                    <li>Denying bathroom.</li>
                    <li>Force feeding all kinds of filth.</li>
                    <li>Rape and gang rape.</li>
                    <li>Sleep deprivation.</li>
                    <li>Forcing the body in an uncomfortable position for extended periods of time (up to 20 hours).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                There is not only physical torture. Practicioners have been fired from their workplaces, their homes ransacked by police, brainwashing in detention centers, receiving threats about family members (e.g. your daughter will have no future) and forced labor. We can see that the suffering of Falun Gong practicioners in China is no less severe than suffering of disciples of Jesus. The vanity of CCP is not smaller than that of Roman Empire.
                </p><p>
                When persecution against christians ended and people repented for their wrongdoings the plagues also miraculously vanished. Soon after the Roman Empire collapsed. For ignoring the crimes of CCP we are suffering from the CCP virus. Those who do not distance themselves from CCP are in great danger.
                </p><p>
                Another thing to note is that Falun Gong practicioners are given chances before and after torture to renounce their practice and if they do then the CCP just lets them go - just for signing some documents. However only a minority of practicioners do that. Satan is standing behind the CCP and before he dies he wants to drag down to 
                <a target="_blank" href="https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/2/15/183258.html">hell</a>
                as many as possible.
                </p><p>
                CCP should be disintegrated as soon as possible.

                <h2>Petition text</h2>
                <p>Peticija Lietuvos Respublikos Seimo pirmininkui, Lietuvos Respublikos ministrui pirmininkui - su raginimu imtis veiksmų, kad būtų nedelsiant nutrauktas masinis organų grobimas ir praktikuojančių Falun Gong (Falun Dafa) bei kitų sąžinės kalinių Kinijoje persekiojimas.</p>
                <p>Mes, Lietuvos Respublikos piliečiai, raginame jus priimti tvirtas nuostatas prieš Kinijos komunistų partijos nuo 1999 m. liepos 20 d. vykdomas praktikuojančių Falun Gong represijas, įskaitant neteisėtą kalinimą kalėjimuose, smegenų plovimo contruose, kankinimus bei masines žudynes dėl organų transplantacijos.</p>
                <p>Mes, žemiau pasirašiusieji, esame šokiruoti pateiktais šių veiksmų įrodymais. Manome, kad žudymas dėl organų yra nusikaltimas žmonijai ir blogio pasireiškimas jo kraštutine forma. Mūsų moraline pareiga yra pasiekti, kad Lietuvos Seimas tarpvalstybine rezoliucija pasmerktų tuos žiaurumus. Esame įsitikinė, kad tai užkirs kelią Kinijai taikyti tokius pat nusikalstamus metodus uigūrų, tibetiečių ir krikščionių atžvilgiu. Taigi mes reikalaujame iš Lietuvos valdžios institucijų:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Pareikalauti, kad Kinija nedelsiant nutrauktų areštuotų praktikuojančių Falun Gang organų grobimą.</li>
                    <li>Pradėti tolesnį tyrima, kurio dėka galima bus patraukti baudžiamojon atsakomybėn kaltininkus, susijusius su Kinija dėl šio nusikaltimo žmonijai.</li>
                    <li>Pareikalauti, kat Kinijos vyriausybė nedelsiant nutrauktų bet kokius praktikuojančių Falun Gang persekiojimus, taip pat jų organų grobimą, kas yra nusikaltimas žmonijai.</li>
                    <li>Įgyvendinti 2013 m. gruodžio 12 d. Europos Parlamento rezoliuciją dėl galimybės gauti organus iš Kinijos panaikinimo.</li>
